Remember that you now must have, on your computers

A Virtual Machine (with Hyper-V) running Windows 11
The Windows Subsystem for Linux (in your host and possibly, in VM) with a Linux distribution (any Ubuntu 22 LTS version will do)
Anaconda (one-click install with the Navigator)
Jupyter Notebook Server
Visual Studio Code
Notepad++
Thank you!
